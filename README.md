# IoT Web Starter Template (CodeIgniter 4)

## Description
The **IoT Web Starter Template (CodeIgniter 4)** is a reusable starter project for building Internet of Things (IoT) applications with a lightweight yet structured web backend. It is built using **CodeIgniter 4**, following MVC architecture and RESTful API principles to support IoT device communication, data handling, and basic web dashboards.

This template is designed to serve as a **foundation** for academic projects, capstone systems, campus IoT deployments, and rapid IoT prototyping.
